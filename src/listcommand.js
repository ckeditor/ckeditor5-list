				//    should not end up as a child of any of list items that they were not children of before.
				// 3. All other items should have their indent changed relatively to it's parent.
				//
				// For example:
				// 1  * --------
				// 2     * --------
				// 3        * -------- <- this is turned off.
				// 4           * -------- <- this has to become indent = 0, because it will be first item on a new list.
				// 5              * -------- <- this should be still be a child of item above, so indent = 1.
				// 6        * -------- <- this also has to become indent = 0, because it shouldn't end up as a child of any of items above.
				// 7           * -------- <- this should be still be a child of item above, so indent = 1.
				// 8     * -------- <- this has to become indent = 0.
				// 9        * -------- <- this should still be a child of item above, so indent = 1.
				// 10          * -------- <- this should still be a child of item above, so indent = 2.
				// 11          * -------- <- this should still be at the same level as item above, so indent = 2.
				// 12 * -------- <- this and all below are left unchanged.
				// 13    * --------
				// 14       * --------
				//
				// After turning off 3 the list becomes:
				//
				// 1  * --------
				// 2     * --------
				//
				// 3  --------
				//
				// 4  * --------
				// 5     * --------
				// 6  * --------
				// 7     * --------
				// 8  * --------
				// 9     * --------
				// 10       * --------
				// 11       * --------
				// 12 * --------
				// 13    * --------
				// 14       * --------
				//
				// Thanks to this algorithm no lists are mismatched and no items get unexpected children/parent, while
				// those parent-child connection which are possible to maintain are still maintained. It's worth noting
				// that this is the same effect that we would be get by multiple use of outdent command. However doing
				// it like this is much more efficient because it's less operation (less memory usage, easier OT) and
